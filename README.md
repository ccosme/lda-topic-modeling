# Themes and trends in condensed matter physics research from 2012-2021
Applied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to perform topic modeling to discover themes and trends in Condensed Matter Physics Research from 2012-2021.

## Data Source
Academic papers uploaded to arXiv.org categorized under condensed matter physics for the period 2012 to 2022 were collected through the metadata file made available through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv) in json format. This is updated weekly and is one of the recommended methods of accessing arXiv data.

A total of 143,249 papers were extracted. Features pertinent to this analysis include the title, abstract, version history, and date of publication.
